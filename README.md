## Multi-player Flappy Bird style iOS game built with Realtime Framework
We all agree that Flappy Bird was a great game. At Realtime we thought it would be even greater if it allowed two players to play against each other, so we decided to give it a go.

In a couple of days part of our Realtime Framework team got together to use the Realtime SDKs along with the standard iOS libraries to build a multi-player Flappy Bird style game.

## About the Realtime Framework
The Realtime Framework is presented in two plafforms: Realtime Cloud Storage and Realtime Cloud Messaging.

Realtime Cloud Storage is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. You can use Realtime Cloud Storage to create database tables that can store and retrieve any amount of data, and serve any level of request traffic.

Realtime Cloud Messaging uses the Pub/Sub (publish/subscribe) messaging pattern, where senders of messages, called publishers, do not program the messages to be sent directly to specific receivers, called subscribers. Published messages are published to topic channels, without knowledge of what, if any, subscribers there may be. Similarly, subscribers express interest in one or more topic channels, and only receive messages that are of interest, without knowledge of what, if any, publishers there are.
