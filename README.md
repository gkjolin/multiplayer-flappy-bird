## Multi-player Flappy Bird style iOS game built with Realtime Framework
We all agree that Flappy Bird was a great game. At Realtime we thought it would be even greater if it allowed two players to play against each other, so we decided to give it a go.

In a couple of days part of our Realtime Framework team got together to use the Realtime SDKs along with the standard iOS libraries to build a multi-player Flappy Bird style game.
